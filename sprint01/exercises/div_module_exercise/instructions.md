# Div module instructions

In this exercise we are going to make a function that divides(yes...). first you need to open the file `div_module/lib/div_module.ex`. Then you need to make a function that takes 2 arguments and returns their division in a tuple `{:ok, result}`. If its a division by 0 return `{:error, "attempt at division by zero"}`. run `mix test` in div_module directory to see if your function passes the test and meets the requirements.
